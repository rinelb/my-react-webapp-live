            <h4>Welcome :)</h4>

            <p className='p-5'>Life tends to be filled with ups and downs. The "ups" take care of themselves 
                ... it’s like riding a bike downhill you just enjoy. It’s the "downs" where we 
                have to put in the efforts. I know it sounds upside down, downs should be easier, 
                knowledge is like that, it’s confusingly simple. The more you analyse, the less 
                simple you make it, the more confusing it becomes. As they say if you cannot explain 
                it to a child and have them understand it, then sorry to say you don’t understand 
                it or it’s something that is total Ludacris. Try this out, try to explain to a 
                kid about debt and that the earth is trillions of dollars in debt ... lol, to 
                who?! Definitely not me :P<br/><br/>This is what this site is about ... helping you through the downs, simplify 
                    (to the best of my understand at least) the complexity, and sharing my favourite 
                    things in life, fantasy/sci-fi books, food (vegetarian based), peace and happiness and silliness :D
