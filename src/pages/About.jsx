                <br/> 
            <h4>Welcome :)</h4>
            <br/>
            <p>Life thens to be filled with ups and downs. The "ups" take care of them selves ... its like riding a bike down hill you just enjoy.
                <br/>Its the "downs" where we have to put in the efforts. I know it sounds up side down, downs should be easier, thats what i like about life. Its<br/>
                confusingly simple. The more you analys, the less simple you make it, the more confusing it becomes. As they say if you can not explain it to a child<br/>
                and have them understand it, then sorry to say you dont understand it or its something that is total ludarcris. Try this out, try to explain to a kid<br/>
                about debt and that the earth is trillions of dollars in debt ... lol, to who?! Definintly not me :P<br/></p>
                <p>This is what this site is about ... helping you through the downs, simplify (to the best of my understand atleast) the complexity,<br/>
                and sharing my favourate things in life, fantasy/sci-fi books, food (vegitarian based), peace and happiness and silliness :D </p>
